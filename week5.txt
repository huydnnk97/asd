For the practice of week 5, I have decided to create a simple Hello World app using HTML, CSS, and JS (vue.js framework particularly) and testing them on codepen.io. I mainly code in Helloworld.vue and app.vue files for the display of the application. For task 1, I declare a new vue instance with the Vue function displaying the header which contains the line "Hello World". In regards to task 2, I display the image of Vue logo and some text with the guidance of the following tasks. For task 3, I write and display 4 languages HTML, CSS, JS, Vue.js as a horizontal list by using for loop. For the specific data, I declare them inside the data function of export default. For the user input, I use element <input> with the content of "Enter the skill you have" for handling user input. Components are reusable Vue instances with a name and it can be reused as many times as we want. It is one of the most important features in Vue.js.
